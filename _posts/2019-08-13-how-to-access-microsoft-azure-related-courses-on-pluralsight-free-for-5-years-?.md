Pluralsight is a great online platform to learn new skills and i admit it has always been my go-to option to strengthen my knowledge on any microsoft azure service which i need to work on.  

I was aware that pluralsight and Microsoft had partnered but never went through the details of this partnership.  
Recently, while browsing the **Microsoft Learn** [documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/azure/) i came across the benefits of this partnership for a learner like myself.

Clicking on **"See All Free Online Courses"** will redirect to the pluralsight website's benefits details page which looks like this:
![Register Azure Pluralsight Benefits]({{ "/images/pluralsight-azure-register.PNG" | absolute_url }})  

After clicking on **"Register and Start Free"** , we need to fill up the pop-up form that appears on the screen, accepting **Terms of Use & Privacy Policy** and Hit **"I Agree, Activate Benefit"** 

![Register Azure Pluralsight Benefits]({{ "/images/pluralsight-azure-register-form.PNG" | absolute_url }})  

This will create a new pluralsight account (incase we don't have one) or will activate the benefit to existing pluralsight account .
Once the account is created, we receive an email from pluralsight having login details.

After logging in with the pluarlsight account just created, pluralsight's default landing page is the azure courses library page having all the courses which are available for free. 

![Azure Pluralsight Courses]({{ "/images/pluralsight-azure-courses.PNG" | absolute_url }})  

We can also browse to the **Account Settings** to see the type of subscription linked to our account. In our case we can see we got access to **Microsoft Azure (Limited Library)** for 5 YEARS.

Highlights of this benefit:  
+ The azure courses library gets updated frequently which gives us access to latest azure courses as well.
+ We can even download the course for offline viewing.
+ This benefit also gives access to Azure related Role IQ Assessments on pluralsight.
+ This benefit is for 5 YEARS :heart_eyes: .  

Hope you like this post and Keep Learning !
